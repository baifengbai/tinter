# tinter
This is 'tinter', not the popular dating app 'tinder' - but if you are searching for that special package to generate shades and tints, look no further.

This simple package solves a simple problem. Provided a single colour, how does one generate a gradient of shades and tints in both directions.

It uses base package grDevices and works nicely with magrittr package for pipes.
